## Notes

I have built and designed the widget as closely as I could to the images provided and tried to incorporate gamification
into it. I have unit tested the components with 100% coverage. I have built the components to be as reusable a generic 
as possible so that should any extension need to be done to the test it can be done with ease and speed.

Should I have had more time I would have included integration and UI tests as well as make the Input component 
much more generic with the ability to RegEx check different input types (email addresses, text only, etc). 
The widget component titles also need some icons to go a long side them.
